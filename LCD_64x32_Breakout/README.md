A PCB to provide a simpler 0.1" header to the tiny ST7567 32x64 monochrome LCD. The pinout matches a lot of popular "blue" PCB breakout boards sold on AliExpress. It can be soldered with a small tip soldering iron, but would be easier to do with a hot air gun.

The image shows the 3D render from KiCad of the front ant back.
