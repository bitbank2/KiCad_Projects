A simple DS3231 RTC breakout board. It includes a 5 pin 0.1" header matched to the Raspberry Pi 40 pin header. The "++" refers to the added feature of having the IRQ pin broken out to a pin that was unused on similar breakouts. I also added a Qwiic I2C connector and backup battery cutoff switch. I wanted the switch because I've left these devices in a drawer before without proper shutdown and the battery will run down. By the time you're ready to use them, the battery is dead.
