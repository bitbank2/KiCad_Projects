A collection of KiCad PCB projects. I've included the Gerber files (zipped) so that you can directly order these PCBs from your favorite PCB supplier without having to use KiCad.<br>

# DS3231 Plus 

A DS3231 realtime clock breakout board modelled after the RPI RTC boards. The 5 pin header matches the pinout of the Raspberry Pi and adds the interrupt pin (pulled up to 3.3v). It includes a QWIIC connector (JST 4-pin 1mm) and I also added a small switch to completely disconnect the backup battery if you plan on leaving it unused for an extended period of time. There's a small CR44 backup battery soldered to the back side.<br>
